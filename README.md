This self-assessment for effective teaching allows you to evaluate and reflect upon your competencies in key areas of teaching and course delivery.  The purpose of the self-assessment is to provide a baseline of your pedagogical, technical, and administrative skills. As part of your results, you will receive additional guidance/resources for each competency that will support your course prep each semester and strengthen your teaching practice. 

This self-assessment is based on the Faculty Self-Assessment developed by Penn State University.
